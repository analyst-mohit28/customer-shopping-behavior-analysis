## 🗄 SQL Business Analysis

### Revenue by Gender

```sql
SELECT gender, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM customers
GROUP BY gender;
```

📌 Insight:
Male customers contribute nearly 2.1x more revenue than female customers.

---

### Subscription vs Non-Subscription Revenue

```sql
SELECT subscription_status, SUM(purchase_amount)
FROM customers
GROUP BY subscription_status;
```

📌 Insight:
Subscribers do not significantly outperform non-subscribers in average spending, indicating weak subscription monetization.

---

### Discount Dependency

```sql
SELECT product_name,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN discount_applied = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS discount_rate
FROM customers
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY discount_rate DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

📌 Insight:
Certain products show heavy discount dependency, posing potential margin risk.
