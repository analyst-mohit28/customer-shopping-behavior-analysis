# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
Tools Used: Python | SQL | Power BI

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to understand revenue patterns, discount usage, subscription impact, and customer loyalty. The goal is to derive data-backed insights that can support business and marketing decisions.

## What Was Done
- Explored and cleaned the dataset using Python
- Handled missing values and created derived features such as age groups
- Used SQL to answer business-focused analytical questions
- Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize customer behavior and trends

## Key Analysis Areas
- Revenue distribution across customer demographics
- Impact of discounts on customer spending
- Comparison of subscribed vs non-subscribed customers
- Identification of discount-dependent products
- Customer segmentation into new, returning, and loyal groups
- Revenue contribution across age groups

## Key Insights
- Male customers contribute significantly higher total revenue compared to female customers
- Discounts do not always reduce spending; some customers spend above average even when discounts are applied
- Subscription status does not significantly increase average spend, but many repeat buyers are not subscribed
- Revenue is fairly evenly distributed across age groups

## Business Value
This analysis helps identify opportunities for improving subscription conversion, optimizing discount strategies, and targeting high-value customer segments.
