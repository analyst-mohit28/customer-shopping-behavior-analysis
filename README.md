Tools Used: Python | SQL | Power BI

Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to understand revenue distribution, discount usage, subscription impact, and customer loyalty. The objective is to derive data-backed insights that support better business and marketing decisions.

Data & Tools
- Python was used for data understanding, cleaning, and feature creation  
- SQL was used to answer business-driven analytical questions  
- Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard for visualization  

Analysis Workflow
1. Explored and cleaned the dataset using Python  
2. Handled missing values and created age group segmentation  
3. Performed business analysis using SQL queries  
4. Built a Power BI dashboard to summarize insights  

Key Business Questions Answered
- How is revenue distributed across customer demographics?
- Do discounts reduce or maintain customer spending?
- Does subscription status impact average spend and total revenue?
- Which products are most discount-dependent?
- How does revenue vary by age group?

Python: Data Preparation
Python was used to understand the dataset structure, handle missing values, and prepare features for analysis.
